# Bash Scripts by Rishav Diyali

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  
This repository is my personal collection of handy Bash scripts that Iâ€™ve written to automate tasks, streamline workflows, and make development life a little easier.

## About

I often find myself repeating the same commands or managing projects manually, so I started collecting scripts that help me save time. This repo contains scripts I use regularly and some Iâ€™ve shared with friends and colleagues.

## Scripts Included

- **gh-init-repo**: Quickly initialize a local Git repository, create a GitHub repo, and push your first commit. Supports both public and private repos.
- **gh-delete-repo**: Safely delete a GitHub repository along with its local git history â€” designed to avoid accidents.
- **Other utility scripts**: Handy tools for file management, project setup, and small automation tasks.

## Features

- Easy to use â€” run scripts directly from the terminal.  
- Safety checks to prevent accidental mistakes (like deleting important files).  
- Modular â€” you can add your own scripts to the repo easily.  
- Minimal setup required.

## Usage

Clone the repository and start using the scripts:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:G-O-T-W/bash-scripts.git
cd bash-scripts
./gh-init-repo my-project --private
